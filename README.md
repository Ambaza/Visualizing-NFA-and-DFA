# Visualizing-NFA-and-DFA
Visualizations to the NFA and DFA implementations using Graphviz. Additionally, we can create a simple grep-like tool in Python. Note that the grep-like tool is a basic implementation and doesn't cover all the features of the actual grep command.

This simple grep tool reads a file line by line and prints lines that match the specified regular expression pattern along with their line numbers. You can replace "regex" with your desired regular expression pattern and use it on different files.
